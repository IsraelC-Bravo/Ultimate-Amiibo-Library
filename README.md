## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Api

I started with a simple HTML for content and structure, CSS for rwd, background & layout. After that, JS to fetch the public API and interaction. 


## Optimizations

Improve the form to be able to take all types of input, expand the api libary, and add an Error message for invalid inputs.
